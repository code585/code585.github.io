                    <h1><i class="fas fa-ad"></i> Tell Trump "You are not invited"</h1>
                    <p>Growing up, and as a young person I greatly admired Sen John McCain. I admired his sense of honor, his sense of public service, and his sense of humor. Through his 30 years in the senate he was hard to tack down because he simply refused to follow a party line that moved in and out of sync with his own strongly held morality.</p>
                    <p>This website is a sort of tribute page to John McCain. Over the next few months I will highlight articles about him, interviews with him, and speeches that he has given. And throughout I will be encouraging people to emulate this important and heroic American figure.</p>
                    <p>There are two specific ways I think we should honor Senator McCain. First he understood that President Trump was a danger to our Democracy, and as such I am encouraging anyone who reads this to donate time and money to support Trump’s defeat this fall.</p>
                    <p>Second he didn’t want Trump attending his funeral. As such this webpage will allow you, in exchange for a donation to Joe Bidon’s presidential campaign of any amount, to send a message to the president proactively disinviting him from attending your funeral.</p>
                    <p>Failure to participate could lead to such terrible consequences as the president winning reelection, or groping one of your grieving loved ones…</p>
                    <p><a id="donate" target="_blank" href="https://joebiden.com/donate-embed/">Please give generously.</a></p>
